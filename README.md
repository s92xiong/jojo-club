## About This Project
This web app hosts an exclusive clubhouse where members can write anonymous posts. Inside this clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is, but outside they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it. 


## Frameworks
This project was built using Node/Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, and the Pug template engine.


## What I learned
This project has afforded me the opportunity to work on my authentication skills with Express. I used Passport.js (passport-local strategy) to implement a secure form of user authentication while also working on my database skills with MongoDB. Furthermore, I decided to implement a variety of CSS media queries and breakpoints (influenced by Bootstrap) to provide a more mobile-friendly viewing for different screen sizes.
